# High-Doom
High Doom is a western themed action horror first person shooter. After a long time traveling, you stop by a desolate town that holds a big mystery and horrors beyond your imagination. Solve puzzles to progress through the levels, surviving against waves of creatures of the night as you piece together the history of the town.

The game is part of the 2024 Spring "AI for Game Programming" class at UCF. Our game went on to make it to the university's showcase, where it won the "Most Complete" award for our team's dedication to creating a complete and polished product.
